BattleCore
==========

Common classes and functions used across all the Battle plugins.

The goal of this project is to eventually hold all the common utility classes shared across all the Battle plugins.
As of now, they are all spread throughout different projects and various different versions of the same classes
are just in the projects directly. So whenever we need to update those classes, we have to go into all those projects
and update them individually. The goal for this project is to change that.
